- **Topic Learned**: Arduino basic course started. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - toggled on and off the 13 pin led

- **Topic Learned**: Learned to blink leds on protoboard and bit counter. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - lighting on and off the leds in sequential order
    - use of arrays and loops to avoid code duplication and ease of manipulating sequence of leds
- **Challenges Faced**: ðŸ˜¶
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Back and forth for leds. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Implemented a simple back and forth loop, that increases delay as per back and forth iteration, then it resets
- **Challenges Faced**: ðŸ˜¶
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶
