- **Topic Learned**: Have first interaction with CAD. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Sketched a piece, with constraints in Free CAD
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand the worflow and errors in CAD (Free CAD)
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Learnt how to move a servo in arduino, with Servo ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Move a servo
    - Back and forth movement with PWD signal
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand that the degrees are not inclusive, probably limitations of the hardware
- **Reflection**: If I want to build something useful and durable, need to buy better motors

- **Topic Learned**: Learned to blink leds on protoboard and bit counter. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - lighting on and off the leds in sequential order
    - use of arrays and loops to avoid code duplication and ease of manipulating sequence of leds
- **Challenges Faced**: ðŸ˜¶
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Back and forth for leds. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Implemented a simple back and forth loop, that increases delay as per back and forth iteration, then it resets
- **Challenges Faced**: ðŸ˜¶
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶
