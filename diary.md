- **Topic Learned**: Manipulating cursor sprite with potentiometer and displaying it in OLED Screen  ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Try to practice my current knowledge of 1 month of Electronics, by trying to move a cursor I made in ms paint, having a potentiometer and a push button for switching between x and y movement
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand that potentiomenter single input affects boths current x and y position, so make sense to use separate potentiometers for easy control and code implementation
- **Reflection**: Still want to try to fix the single potentiometer control ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Have first interaction with a OLED Screen  ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Tested and write some text in a small 128x32 OLED Screen I bought from aliexpress
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand binary format for image representation, SLC and SDA outputs
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Learnt how to move a servo in arduino, with Servo and push button ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Move a servo
    - Incremental move when push btn is pressed and reset
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand EMI interference, when reading the input and pull down, pull up resistor schematics for draining unwanted floating signal
- **Reflection**: Have to keep practicing reading inputs to masterize this topic

- **Topic Learned**: Have first interaction with CAD. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Sketched a piece, with constraints in Free CAD
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand the worflow and errors in CAD (Free CAD)
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Learnt how to move a servo in arduino, with Servo ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Move a servo
    - Back and forth movement with PWD signal
- **Challenges Faced**: 
    - Understand that the degrees are not inclusive, probably limitations of the hardware
- **Reflection**: If I want to build something useful and durable, need to buy better motors

- **Topic Learned**: Learned to blink leds on protoboard and bit counter. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - lighting on and off the leds in sequential order
    - use of arrays and loops to avoid code duplication and ease of manipulating sequence of leds
- **Challenges Faced**: ðŸ˜¶
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶

- **Topic Learned**: Back and forth for leds. ðŸ“š
- **What I did**:  
    - Implemented a simple back and forth loop, that increases delay as per back and forth iteration, then it resets
- **Challenges Faced**: ðŸ˜¶
- **Reflection**: ðŸ˜¶
